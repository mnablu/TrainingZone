    <h3>The Camertata Singers</h3>
  </div>
  <p>The concept of the  Camerata Singers originated in the 1980s when Susan Grinsell, who was teaching  voice at James Cook University realised that ensemble singing was sadly lacking  for tertiary music students. Since then, Susan, along with repetiteur Carol Dall Osto,  has strived to bring quality ensemble singing to the wider community by  performing at events from the Ingham Italian Festival through to Cotters  Markets in the mall.</p>

  <h3>STOKES-NICHOLSON BIG BAND</h3>
  <p>The Stokes Nicholson Big  Band was formed in 1991 through collaboration between the late Roy Stokes and  Les Nicholson. Each man had his own individual reasons for wanting a Big Band,  perhaps influenced by the difference in their ages with Roy being 17 years  older than Les. Roy wanted to create an opportunity to keep experienced  musicians playing challenging music so their talents didn't go rusty. Les came  from a different perspective and wanted to provide an opportunity for music  students of all ages to sit beside experienced jazz musicians to absorb the  musical synergy that classroom teaching alone cannot develop. </p>
