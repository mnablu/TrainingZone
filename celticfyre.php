<p><strong>The alternative celtic rock band from North Queensland</strong><br>
  <br>
Typical audience response: - "WOW - I wasn't                prepared for that! Racing around the stage in kilts, blowing bagpipes, jumping                from one instrument to the next, these guys know how to entertain!" <br>
<br>
They will break your heart with the mournful and eerie sounds of the Great                Highland Bagpipe and then crank it up real hard and rock you 'til you drop. <br>
<br>
This 11 piece band  is a fun-loving kick-em-in-the-pants band that just wants to rock - celtic style! <br>
