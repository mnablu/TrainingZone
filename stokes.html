  <h3>STOKES-NICHOLSON BIG BAND</h3>
  <h4><img src="Images/SNBB1.jpg" alt="" width="692" height="291" id="SNBB_JPEG"/>The Stokes Nicholson Big  Band was formed in 1991 through collaboration between the late Roy Stokes and  Les Nicholson.</h4>
  <p> Each man had his own individual reasons for wanting a Big Band,  perhaps influenced by the difference in their ages with Roy being 17 years  older than Les. Roy wanted to create an opportunity to keep experienced  musicians playing challenging music so their talents didn't go rusty. Les came  from a different perspective and wanted to provide an opportunity for music  students of all ages to sit beside experienced jazz musicians to absorb the  musical synergy that classroom teaching alone cannot develop. </p>
  <p>A number of experienced  musicians were invited to join the various sections of the new Big Band with  most sections being led by a member of Les' already well-established Pacific  Mainstream Jazz Band. The original Principals were Roy Stokes (not a member of  PMJB), saxophone; Les Nicholson, trumpet; Neville Minon, trombone; and Bob  Hebden, rhythm. Roy, Neville and Peter Alloway were all still private music  teachers at this time and some of their pupils were the first students to be  part of this adventure. </p>
  <p>The Stokes Nicholson Big  Band was up and running, meeting once a month for rehearsals with an  expectation that each section would practise individually or as a group in  between these rehearsals.</p>
  <p>Sadly Roy passed away on  1st January 1993 after a period of illness. Les continued to manage the band  and conduct rehearsals, as well as playing first trumpet. In 1997 he enlisted  the help of John Ruffle who took on the role of Musical Director, allowing Les  to relax a little and enjoy his playing more. Roy would no doubt be very proud  to see how much his beloved Big Band has developed since its formation as it is  now a very accomplished band with a diverse repertoire and the technical  expertise capable of backing great Jazz singers.</p>
  <p>The band today  demonstrates it has achieved the aims of both Roy and Les with experienced  musicians arriving in town and feeling very proud to join such a powerful big  band. A number of the original student members from 1991 are still in the band  and have now joined the ranks of the experienced musicians and new students are  still progressing from school bands to the Stokes Nicholson Big Band.</p>
