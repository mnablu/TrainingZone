<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The overall success of the website will be based primarily  upon the income of the business; observing for whether there is a considerable  increase in revenue. The success will also be proven by  how many new members and viewers have been established, especially if they are  within the general scope of the specified <em>targeted  audience</em>. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
