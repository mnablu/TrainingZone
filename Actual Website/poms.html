  <h3>Poms from Oz</h3>
  <p>Poms from Oz are Judy,  Kathleen and Alan Pomeroy, a family of solo vocalists from North Queensland,  Australia. All are dinky di Oz with Judy and Kathy being descendents of First  Fleeters. </p>
  <p>Their tight harmony and  vocal strength bring a fresh feel to original, contemporary and traditional  works, uncovering a rich tapestry of songs gathered in their travels from  around the world. Most songs are a cappella but sometimes accompanied by guitar  and/or harmonica.  Moods in their songs range from downright to real tear  jerkers and audience participation is encouraged. Their sound is distinctive,  as Judy arranges all the songs specifically for their voices. </p>
  <p>A tast brew of Oz songs  and Oz voices, with a dash of guitar and harmonica. Open a nice bottle of red ,  sit back and enjoy.</p>
