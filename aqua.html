  <h3>Aquapella</h3>
  <p><img src="Images/Aquapella01.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="363" id="AquaJPEG"/>Aquapella are 50 singers  from the Townsville area bringing you a cappella world music at its very best:  inspiring and uplifting harmonies from around the globe. A South African party  song, a Hungarian love triangle, &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; in French  - a sumptuous variety of different languages, stories, rhythms and moods to  entertain and move you in the wonderful common language of music. Come along  and travel the world by song!  </p>
  <p>Choir director Beat  Lehmann was born in Switzerland where he first became involved in choir music  by participating in classical productions like Handel's Messiah, Mozart's Mass  in C minor etc. A study year abroad gave him the opportunity to sing with the  Pontardullais Welsh Male Choir. </p>
  <p>After completing an M.A. in Social Anthropology  he concentrated on his other passion, dance, directing a Modern Dance Company  for several years. In 1986, Beat migrated to Australia where he completed a  Ph.D. in Linguistics and involved himself in choir music again. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For 12 years he  conducted AkaBella, a well-known world music choir from Bellingen, NSW.  AkaBella participated in major festivals like the National Folk Festival in  Canberra, the Bellingen Global Carnival and theWoodford Folk Festival where  they featured in the ABC documentary iFestival on Fire and launched their  first CD 'Mosaic'. </p>
  <p>Beat moved to Magnetic Island in 2003 and has established a  similarly successful world music choir for the Townsville area. Beat's choirs  focus on the rich musical heritage of cultures around the globe. A South African  party song, a Hungarian love triangle, a Mexican lullaby, a French version of  'The Lion Sleeps Tonight' to delve into the incredible variety and depth of a  cappella world music and the cultures it represents, is not only fun, but a  very enriching and uplifting experience.</p>
  <p>Aquapella won the ABC  Choir of the Year competition for Queensland in 2006.<br>
