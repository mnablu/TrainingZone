  <h3>The Camertata Singers</h3>
  <p>The concept of the  Camerata Singers originated in the 1980s when Susan Grinsell, who was teaching  voice at James Cook University realised that ensemble singing was sadly lacking  for tertiary music students. Since then, Susan, along with repetiteur Carol Dall Osto,  has strived to bring quality ensemble singing to the wider community by  performing at events from the Ingham Italian Festival through to Cotters  Markets in the mall.</p>
  <p id="readmorelink">The Camerata Singers  comprises a group of trained singers, both male and female, from age 18 and  over who strive to provide quality performances in a range of styles from  classical through to A cappella and contemporary. A number of members also  regularly participate in local music theatre and theatre productions.</p>
