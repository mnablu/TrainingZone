<h3>The Camertata Singers</h3>
<center><img src="Images/Camerata.jpg" width="50%" alt="The Camertata Singers Image"></center>
<p>The concept of the  Camerata Singers originated in the 1980s when Susan Grinsell, who was teaching  voice at James Cook University realised that ensemble singing was sadly lacking  for tertiary music students. Since then, Susan, along with repetiteur Carol Dall Osto,  has strived to bring quality ensemble singing to the wider community by  performing at events from the Ingham Italian Festival through to Cotters  Markets in the mall.</p>

<h3>Celtic Fyre</h3>
<center><img src="Images/Celtic-Fyre-Wall-with-Fire8.jpg" width="50%" alt="Celtic Fyre Image"></center>
<h4>The alternative celtic  rock band from North Queensland</h4>
<p>Typical audience  response:  &quot;WOW - I wasn't prepared for that! Racing around the stage in  kilts, blowing bagpipes, jumping from one instrument to the next, these guys  know how to entertain!&quot;</p>
<p>They will break your  heart with the mournful and eerie sounds of the Great Highland Bagpipe and then  crank it up real hard and rock you 'til you drop. </p>
<p>This 11 piece band is a  fun-loving kick-em-in-the-pants band that just wants to rock - celtic style! </p>

<h3>Poms from Oz</h3>

<p>Poms from Oz are Judy,  Kathleen and Alan Pomeroy, a family of solo vocalists from North Queensland,  Australia. All are dinky di Oz with Judy and Kathy being descendents of First  Fleeters. </p>

<p>Moods in their songs range from downright to real tear  jerkers and audience participation is encouraged. Their sound is distinctive,  as Judy arranges all the songs specifically for their voices. </p>
<p>A tast brew of Oz songs  and Oz voices, with a dash of guitar and harmonica. Open a nice bottle of red ,  sit back and enjoy.

<h3>Stokes-Nicholson Big Band</h3>
<center><img src="Images/SNBB1.jpg" width="50%" alt="Stokes-Nicholson Big Band Image"></center>
<p>The Stokes Nicholson Big  Band was formed in 1991 through collaboration between the late Roy Stokes and  Les Nicholson. Each man had his own individual reasons for wanting a Big Band,  perhaps influenced by the difference in their ages with Roy being 17 years  older than Les. Roy wanted to create an opportunity to keep experienced  musicians playing challenging music so their talents didn't go rusty. Les came  from a different perspective and wanted to provide an opportunity for music  students of all ages to sit beside experienced jazz musicians to absorb the  musical synergy that classroom teaching alone cannot develop. </p>
