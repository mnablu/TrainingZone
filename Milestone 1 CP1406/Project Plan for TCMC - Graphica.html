<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>The Townsville Community Music Centre website is intended to promote the organisation in order to increase company revenue, customers and members. This website is needed to promote the organisation and give information on events which the organisation is hosting. By promoting The Townsville Community Music Centre, events hosted by the organisation will receive more attention therefore increasing customers and engagement from members.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The overall success of the website will be based primarily  upon the income of the business; observing for whether there is a considerable  increase in revenue. The success will also be proven by  how many new members and viewers have been established, especially if they are  within the general scope of the specified <em>targeted  audience</em>. Current company advertising should remain on a consistent model for a period of six months to ensure that any changes in the organisations success is a result of the websites implementation. At the end of the six month period, any changes in customer numbers, revenue, member numbers and member engagement will be assessed and the website success will be determined.  &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The website will appeal to a mature target audience; catering  to those who have reached adult hood through to the middle-aged. The specific  range would be measured at around the ages of 19 &ndash; 60 years. &nbsp;<br>
This being the case, the design of the complete website would  have to comprise of darker colours, thus incorporating a full juxtaposition of contemporary  themes with an old-fashioned flair while all together remaining as user friendly  as possible.</p>
